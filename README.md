Project 3 (Final Project) for ST 558

# ST558-RProj3


**Brief description of the app and its purpose.**

     This code will gather 

• A list of packages needed to run the app.
• A line of code that would install all the packages used (so we can easily grab that and run it prior to
running your app).
• The shiny::runGitHub() code that we can copy and paste into RStudio to run your app.
